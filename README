This code is in development.

To test you need the following packages:
"python-dev", "libasound2-dev", "libjack-dev or libjack-jackd2-dev", "make", "gcc"
Launch "make" (solve dependencies problems)
For old jack api, the environment variable OLDJACKAPI must be set.
ex: OLDJACKAPI=yes make or export OLDJACKAPI=yes; make

Then launch "./test_midilooper.sh"
